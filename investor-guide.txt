What to Consider when Investing: 
1) Risk: Every investment comes with risk. You are never guaranteed to profit or cut even with your investment within the market.
2) Diversification: A diverse portfolio is a strategy to spread your investments across various industries to reduce overall risk. 
3) Time Horizon: Consider the length of time you plan to hold an investment before selling it. This will impact your investing strategy and risk tolerance. 
        
The Advantages of Investing: 
1) Potential for higher returns than other low risk investments 
2) Can help 'combat' inflation 
3) An opportunity to grow your wealth and achieve financial goals 

The Risks of Investing: 
1) No certainty you will maintain or profit from your investment - the money you invest should NOT be money you are directly dependent upon 
2) Time, Money, and Energy is needed to invest 
3) Constant market fluctuations can cause anxiety and stress
